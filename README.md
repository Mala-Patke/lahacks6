# Los Altos Hacks VI - Flood is Thicker than Water

## Inspiration
Climate change is an issue our generation is all too familiar with. Now, the disastrous consequences of the future have become our present. This summer, seasonal rains in Pakistan spiraled into extreme flooding, covering 1/3 of the country and displacing 1/6 of the population. Often, tragedies like this must compete against mainstream news and it's easy to lose sight of the humanity behind the statistics. Through Flood is Thicker than Water, we aim to remove this separation and better capture the devastating impact of the floods.

## Functionality
Flood is Thicker than Water is data visualization tool built around damage from potential floods. Users may select a location and observe the size and effects of these floods. The program provides 5 statistics for a selected area:

> Square Mileage Flooded

> Number of People Affected

> Number of People Displaced

> Number of People currently in Shelters

> Total Fatalities

All statistics are modeled off of the effects of the Pakistani floods and their affect/displacement rate.
